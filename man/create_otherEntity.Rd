\usage{
create_otherEntity(
  target_file_or_directory,
  description,
  baseURL = "https://data.gios.asu.edu/datasets/cap/",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  projectNaming = TRUE,
  additional_information = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_file_or_directory}{(charater) The quoted name and path of the data file or directory.}

\item{description}{(character) A description of the data entity.}

\item{baseURL}{(optional)
(character) The base path of the web-accessible location of the data file;
the name of the resulting file will be passed to the base path to generate
a web-resolvable file path.}

\item{overwrite}{(logial)If creating otherEntity by zipping a directory, this is a logical
indicating whether to overwrite an already existing zip file that has the
same name and location as the temporary zip object to be created.}

\item{projectNaming}{(logical) Logical indicating if the file or directory should be renamed per
the style used by the CAP LTER (default) with the package number + base file
name + md5sum + file extension. The passed file or directory name will be
used if this parameter is set to FALSE.}

\item{additional_information}{(character) Additional information about the data object. Should be quoted,
and accepts (but not required) markdown formatting.}
}
\value{
EML entity of type otherEntity is returned. Additionally, the data
 file is renamed with the package number + base file name + md5sum + file
 extension.
}
\description{
create_otherEntity generates a EML entity of type otherEntity.
}
\details{
A otherEntity entity is created from a single file (e.g.,
  desert_fertilization_sampling_sites.kml) or a directory. The resulting
  entity is renamed with the package number + base file name + md5sum + file
  extension. File extension is always .zip if the otherEntity is being
  created by zipping a directory.
}
\note{
create_otherEntity will look for a package number in config.yaml; this
 parameter is not passed to the function and it must exist.

The target data file or directory can be located anywhere on a local
  computer but the renamed file with package number and hash will be written
  to the current working directory.

\examples{
\dontrun{

 # using default parameters

 desert_fertilization_sites <- create_otherEntity(
   target_file_or_directory = "~/Desktop/desert_fertilization_sampling_sites.kml",
   description = "approximate location of desert fertiliztion long-term study sites")

 # set overwrite = TRUE - has the effect of overwriting an existing zipped
 # directory of the same name if the otherEntity is being generated by zipping
 # a directory (i.e. as opposed to from a single file)

 pass_codebook_2011 <- create_otherEntity(
   target_file_or_directory = "PASS-2011-Codebook-Feb2016rev.pdf",
   description = "PASS 2011 survey codebook",
   overwrite = TRUE)

 # example without project naming:

 pass_codebook_2011 <- create_otherEntity(
   target_file_or_directory = "~/Desktop/max_temperature",
   description = "rasters of max temperature years 2000-2016",
   projectNaming = FALSE)

 # The EML::eml$otherEntity() can then be
 # added to a EML::eml$dataset() entity:

 dataset <- EML::eml$dataset(otherEntity = listOfOtherEntities)

}
