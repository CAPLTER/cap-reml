establishes in the R environment upon package load, eml entities

\description{
configure_caplter establishes several data set elements that are
  likely to be consistent across all CAP LTER or GIOS data sets, including
  language, distribution, and access. In addition, address, publisher, and
  contact are established each specific to CAP LTER or GIOS. The appropriate
  reference (to CAP LTER or GIOS) should be made for these elements at the
  time of eml$dataset construction. Note that several elements apply to all
  projects. These include: giosLanguage, capRights, and lterAccess.

  established in the R environment when the capeml package is loaded and
  available for reference in the EML development template. Distribution is
  the exception as this is a function that requires the data set package
  identifier as an input.

# Most entities are simply loaded when the package is loaded without the need
