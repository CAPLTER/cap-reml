#' @description configure_caplter establishes several data set elements that are
#'   likely to be consistent across all CAP LTER or GIOS data sets, including
#'   language, distribution, and access. In addition, address, publisher, and
#'   contact are established each specific to CAP LTER or GIOS. The appropriate
#'   reference (to CAP LTER or GIOS) should be made for these elements at the
#'   time of eml$dataset construction. Note that several elements apply to all
#'   projects. These include: giosLanguage, capRights, and lterAccess.

#' @details configure_caplter establishes several data set elements that are
#'   likely to be consistent across all CAP LTER or GIOS data sets, including
#'   language, distribution, and access. In addition, address, publisher, and
#'   contact are established each specific to CAP LTER or GIOS. The appropriate
#'   reference (to CAP LTER or GIOS) should be made for these elements at the
#'   time of eml$dataset construction. Most of these eml entities are
#'   established in the R environment when the capeml package is loaded and
#'   available for reference in the EML development template. Distribution is
#'   the exception as this is a function that requires the data set package
#'   identifier as an input.

#' @import EML

#' @return establishes in the R environment upon package load, eml entities
#'   referenced in (or outside) a EML development template.

#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#'
#' # Most entities are simply loaded when the package is loaded without the need
#' to call them explicitly. An exception is the create_distribution() function.
